Introduction
============

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the entire processes of building a NLU_
applicaiton that can control lights.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
  * Create Intents and Entities
  * Train your app with test utterances
  * Correct identification errors
  * Perform endpoint testing

Smart Light Tutorial
====================

The following video walks you through the entire process of creating a Smart
Light application.

Creating Smart Light Understanding
==================================

1. Add Intents
__________________

1. Go to NLU_ and create a new NLU app.

2. In the app, click on "Set Up Intents" and add a new intent called `turn_on`.

3. Add the following example utterances:

  * Turn on lights
  * Lights on

4. In the app, click on "Set Up Intents" and add a new intent called `turn_off`.

5. Add the following example utterances:

  * Turn off lights
  * Lights off

You should now have two intents in your *intents* dropdown.

2. Add Entities
_________________

Next, we want our app to identify a specific light.

1. Under "Set Up Entities", add a new entity called `name` to refer to the names
   of the lights.

2. Add the following example phrases:

  * Kitchen
  * Living Room
  * Bedroom

You should have one entity in you *entities* dropdown.

.. image:: _static/img/smartlight/Entities.png
  :align: center

3. Test the App
_______________

1. Test your model in the *"Train the model"* Section. Input a sentence and click
   analyze.

2. Once it has completed, check the result. You can correct the result by clicking
   on the blue button and selecting the correct intent or by highlighting and
   selecting the correct entity. When finished, click submit.

.. tip:: Try novel light names such as "porch", "garage", and "bathroom" to test
    how the model will behave in novel cases.

4. Building a strobe
____________________

After we have tested our app, let's add some more sophisticated actions such as
strobing or `blink`.

1. Add a new intent called `blink`. Don't add any example utterances yet.

  .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/Intents2.png
    :align: center

2. Add a new entity called `color` and add the following example phrases:

  * Red
  * Green
  * Yellow

.. note:: You can add more examples into your phrase list.

3. Add the predefined entity `number`.

  .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/numbers.png
    :align: center

You should now have three entities in your *entities* dropdown.

  .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/Entities2.png
    :align: center

5. Strobe Test
______________

1. Test the following sentence in your model:

  * Blink the bedroom light 5 times red.

.. note:: The App may only be able to recognize name and number and not color.

      .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/Test2.png
        :align: center

2. Once it has completed, check the result. You can correct the result by clicking
   on the blue button and selecting the correct intent or by highlighting the
   correct and selecting the entity. When finished, click submit.

   .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/CorrectEntities.png
     :align: center

.. tip:: Test you app against novel colors.

    In addition, test the app against new `turn_on`/`turn_off` utterances that
    contain a color entity.

        :align: center

3. Once you are done testing you model, click on **Train Model** and then
   **Deploy**.

.. tip:: Use the *Stats bar* and the *Log* to understand how your models performance.

6. Deploy and Testing the endpoint
__________________________________

1. Click on **Deployed** and click on **Test Endpoint** in the dropdown.

  .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/TestEndPoint.png
    :align: center

2. In the pop-up under the **Query** section, enter in a sentence and click test
   end point. You should see the following text in the **Output** section:

  An example output for the utterance *"Blink the bathroom light 8 times in blue"*:

  .. code-block:: javascript

      {
          "tokenized_sentence": "Blink the bathroom light 8 times in blue",
          "intents": [
              {
                  "score": 0.7512977154761208,
                  "intent": "turn_on"
              },
              {
                  "score": 0.2487022845238792,
                  "intent": "turn_off"
              },
              {
                  "score": 0,
                  "intent": "blink"
              }
          ],
          "entities": [
              {
                  "text": "bathroom",
                  "end": 3,
                  "start": 2,
                  "entity": "name"
              },
              {
                  "text": "8",
                  "end": 5,
                  "start": 4,
                  "entity": "number"
              },
              {
                  "text": "blue",
                  "end": 8,
                  "start": 7,
                  "entity": "color"
              }
          ],
          "sentence": "Blink the bathroom light 8 times in blue"
      }

3. Once you have finished Endpoint testing, click on **Show Log**. Note that the
   examples you just tested do not have *User annotations*. If the *App annotations*
   are correct, click on the **Green Thumbs Up**.

   .. image:: _static/img/smartlight/GreenThumb.png
     :align: center

.. note:: When you click on the **Green Thumbs Up**, the *App annotations* will
    automatically be apply onto the *User annotations*.

.. warning:: If there are contradictions in your training data, your accuracy will
    decrease dramatically.

.. tip:: To quickly check performance by intent, click on the **i** button within
    the intent to show the stats. In addition, you can use this dropdown to filter
    the log by each intent.

4. Click on "Show All Apps" to go back to the NLU app list.

5. In your newly created apps bubble, click on Deployment Information and copy
   the **Deployment Url** onto your clipboard.
