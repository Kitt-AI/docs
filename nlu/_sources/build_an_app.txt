Introduction
============

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the entire processes of building a NLU_
applicaiton. Specifically be building the NLU application for the Build a bot
in the `ChatFlow documentation`_

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:
  * Create a NLU app from scratch
  * Add Intents and sample utterances
  * Add Entities and sample phrases
  * Deploy you app in ChatFlow

Create and NLU App

   optimize you NLU app. Afterwards, you will be able to issue RESTful API calls
   to your app.

Final Thoughts
==============

With that, you can configure your NLU application to your ChatFlow_ App. To do so,
drag in an NLU Node, paste the **Deployment Url** in the URL field, and add
``{{{payload}}}`` to the end of the URL.

And with that, you have successfully configured your NLU app to ChatFlow_. For
more examples of ChatFlow Apps with NLU components, check out the `ChatFlow documentation`_.

Happy App Building!!!
