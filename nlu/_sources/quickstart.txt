.. tip:: You can go back an correct previous classifications and see the exact cases
      where the model is failing.

.. note:: In the *Log*, the first row in each entry refers to the **User Annotations**.
    This is where any changes made by the user are stored. The second row
    contains the original predictions from the model or the **App Annotations**.

You are now officially oriented with the NLU Editor! The time has come for you to
build Natural Language Understanding machines! Are you up to the task?
