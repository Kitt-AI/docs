Introduction
============

NLU_ is a Natural Language Understanding engine classifying utterances by **intents**
and extracting content from uttereances called **entities**. In this section of
the documentation, we will discuss in more detail about these two key components
of NLU.

Intents
=======

Intents are utterance classes that capture the main communicative intent of the
input utterance. For example, the intent *dialgoue.yes* captures the communicative
intent of many  utterances, such as "I agree", "yes", "of course", "yes, I agree",
and "I think so too".

The intent vocabulary or **Sample Utterance** consists of an arbitrary number of
arbitrary strings. These intents can be thought of as buckets in which each
incoming input utterance will be placed by the NLU node.

NLU contains some predefined intents which you can use in your NLU app.

Entities
========
In addition to one **intents**, each utterance may contain zero or more **entities**
or subunits of an utterance that contain key information. Common examples of
entities include *locations*, *names of organizations*, and *prices*.

The entity vocabulary or **Phrases** consist of an arbitrary number of words. NLU
will search each utterances for these Phrases. In addition, **entities** can be
learned as a *place* or *occurance* in the utterance. For example, in the utterance
"I want seafood in downtown seattle.", NLU learned that the *location* entity always
occurs after the preposition **"in"**.

.. warning:: You must train your model over a large dataset in order to have your NLU app learn
             where in the utterance a specific **entity** will occur.

NLU contains some predfinied entities which you can use in your NLU app.

A Classification Example
========================

Consider, the following utterance:
  *"Please make me a reservation for six people at Matsuhisa at 7 pm." *

The intent here may be *make_restaurant_reservation*, and the entities may be *party_size*
(corresponding to the word "six"), *restaurant_name* (corresponding to the word
"Matsuhisa") and *time* (corresponding to "7 pm").

.. note:: These assignments are made in the context of the current utterance.
    The word "six" could be a time in a different utterance ("I need a reservation at six").
    It is the job of the NLU to assign the right entities and intents in each utterance.

Definitions
===========

**Intent**
    Utterance classes that capture the main communicative intent of the input
    utterance

**Entity**
    Subunits of an utterances that contain key information we can use in our
    applications.
