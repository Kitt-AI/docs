Introduction
============

In the :ref:`previous <alexa_advanced_title>` tutorial we implemented the `Wise Guy`_
skill with ChatFlow. Everything was smooth except one thing: creating the
`Speech Assets <https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/wiseGuy/speechAssets>`_
can still be a painful experience once your skill gets complicated.

In this tutorial we will show how to use ChatFlow's companion AI engine `NLU`_
to easily generate the Intent Schema and Sample Utterances needed for Speech Assets.

Create an NLU Project
=====================

The following video shows how to quickly create an NLU project for Wise Guy.
It's 6 minutes long and we hope you enjoy Kevin MacLeod's Firebrand as background
music.

You can quickly reproduce this project by importing this :download:`JSON file <_static/json/Wise_Guy_Skill_NLU.json>`
in NLU_.

Exporting to Alexa Format
=========================

Now click "Export" -> "Alexa Skills", three speech assets will appear.
They all follow the format of ASK `Custom Interaction Model <https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interaction-model-reference>`_.

**Intent Schema**

The Intent Schema will contain only user-defined intent and slot. If you need
any Amazon default intent, please manually add them.


.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "intents": [
            {
                "intent": "SetupNameWhoIntent",
                "slots": [
                    {
                        "name": "SetupName",
                        "type": "LIST_OF_SetupName"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "intent": "TellMeAJokeIntent"
            },
            {
                "intent": "WhosThereIntent"
            }
        ]
    }

**Custom Slots**

Custom Slots are list of phrases for slots (entities). NLU also supports list of
regular expressions to match entities but the Alexa console does not support it.

.. code-block:: java

    LIST_OF_SetupName:
    to
    beets
    little Old Lady
    a broken pencil
    snow
    boo
    woo
    spell
    atch
    owls
    berry

**Sample Utterances**

Sample utterances are all utterances in the project, with intents and slots (entities)
marked within utterances. It follows the old verbose style, and you can
`migrate <https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/migrating-to-the-improved-built-in-and-custom-slot-types>`_
to new improved interfaces.

.. code-block:: java

    WhosThereIntent who is there
    WhosThereIntent whos there
    WhosThereIntent who there
    WhosThereIntent who is this
    WhosThereIntent whos this
    TellMeAJokeIntent tell me a joke

    TellMeAJokeIntent will it tell me a knock knock joke
    TellMeAJokeIntent can it tell me a knock knock joke
    TellMeAJokeIntent to tell me a knock knock joke
    SetupNameWhoIntent {to|SetupName} who
    SetupNameWhoIntent {beets|SetupName} who
    SetupNameWhoIntent {snow|SetupName} who
    SetupNameWhoIntent {boo|SetupName} who

    SetupNameWhoIntent {berry|SetupName} who
    SetupNameWhoIntent {little old lady|SetupName} who

Finally, copy these exports and fill them in the Interaction Model following
Step :ref:`sample_utterances` in the basic Alexa tutorial:

Now we have shown you how to quickly build an NLU project and incorporate it
to an Alexa Skill. KITT.AI NLU_ provides an interactive interface for you to
quickly bootstrap an NLU engine with minimal data. You can immediately observe
system's performance, mark and correct inaccurate predictions, and improve the
NLU engine on the fly. It's a great assistant to building an Alexa skill.

Now go build your own awesome Alexa skills.
