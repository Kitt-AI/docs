   *"Hello Goodbye!"* sample project. Click on it. When the page refreshes, you will

* The main area of the *Editor* is the **Canvas**. The nodes in your canvas will
  become the content of our project.

  .. note:: When you select a sample project, the canvas will be already populated by
    several nodes. If you start with a "clean project", the canvas will be
    empty.

* The **Info Tab** on the right side of the *Editor* provides information about
  the current node.

  .. tip:: This is a great resource to learn more about each type of node.

5. Test your bot. Try saying "hi", "hello", and "goodbye" to the bot. The bot
   respond will respond with the appropriate message. If you try to say anything else, it
   will not understand you.
