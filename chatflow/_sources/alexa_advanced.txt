Application Overview
____________________

`Wise Guy`_ is a sample Alexa skill that tells a *knock knock* joke:

*You: "Alexa, ask Wise Guy to tell a joke"*

*Echo: "Knock knock"*

*You: "who's there?"*

*Echo: "Beets!"*

*You: "Beets who?"*

*Echo: "Beats me!"*

This skill highlights Alexa's multi-turn ability using dialogue state tracking.
At any given point, the user can ask for help and Alexa will explain how to proceed.

The main source files are the `Speech Assets <https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/wiseGuy/speechAssets>`_
and `index.js <https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/blob/master/samples/wiseGuy/src/index.js>`_ file.

We'll see how to easily recreate this application with ChatFlow with a more
intuitive interface.

.. _create_wiseguy_chatflow_app:

1. Create the WiseGuy ChatFlow app
---------------------------------

Go to ChatFlow_ and use the sample application "Alexa WiseGuy Skill":

.. image:: _static/img/alexa/chatflow-wise-guy-app.png
   :align: center

The application can almost work out of the box. All we need to do is to copy
the "Final URL" from the **Alexa In** node after hitting "DEPLOY".

Now we are all set! Use the Service Simulator or your Echo device to test it!

.. _multiturn_and_state_tracking_explained:

Multi turn and state tracking explained
=======================================

The ``global`` variable
------------------------

Take a look at the **init JOKE_LIST** state node. In it, we have created a
global variable that can be used across the dialogue. It is called ``JOKE_LIST``
and was set in with the following code:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var JOKE_LIST = [
        {setup: "To", speechPunchline: "Correct grammar is <break time=\"0.2s\" /> to whom.",
        cardPunchline: "Correct grammar is 'to whom'."},
        ...
    ]
    global.set("JOKE_LIST", JOKE_LIST);

Then it can be retrieved later in any function or state node by using::

    var JOKE_LIST = global.get("JOKE_LIST");

The ``global`` environment is limited to the current application. One
application cannot access another application's ``global`` environment.

In addition, in the **init JOKE_LIST** state node, we initialized the dialogue stage::

    msg.kitt.stage = null;

State tracking
--------------

Take a look at the **Tell Me A Joke** state node, it sets up the dialogue stage:

.. image:: _static/img/alexa/tell-me-a-joke.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

.. note:: the *request user input* click at the bottom of state node indicates
   the router to send message out at this state node *right away* without
   attempting to visit another enter/state node.

.. code-block:: javascript

    //Select a random joke and store it in the session variables.
    var jokeID = Math.floor(Math.random() * JOKE_LIST.length);

    //The stage variable tracks the phase of the dialogue.
    //When this function completes, it will be on stage 1.
    msg.kitt.stage = 1;
    msg.kitt.setup = JOKE_LIST[jokeID].setup;
    msg.kitt.speechPunchline = JOKE_LIST[jokeID].speechPunchline;
    msg.kitt.cardPunchline = JOKE_LIST[jokeID].cardPunchline;

Remember that everything in ``msg.kitt`` is maintained by the dialogue router,
persisting over the whole dialogue session. Thus, whenever a new utterance within
the *same* dialogue session comes in, previous turn's ``msg.kitt`` can still be
accessed. ``msg.kitt`` is also assigned to ``sessionAttributes`` *outputted*
through **Alexa Out** and persisted by the Alexa service. So next time an Alexa
`Request <https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/alexa-skills-kit-interface-reference#request-format>`_
comes in, the same session attributes can be accessed via ``msg.alexa.session.attributes``
(maintained by Alexa), or ``msg.kitt`` (maintained by ChatFlow).

The **Who's There** state node then advances the dialogue stage by 1 if previous
``msg.kitt.stage == 1``:

.. image:: _static/img/alexa/whos-there.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (msg.kitt.stage === 1) {
        //Retrieve the joke's setup text.
        speechText = msg.kitt.setup;

        //Advance the stage of the dialogue.
        msg.kitt.stage = 2;

        repromptText = "You can ask, " + speechText + " who?";
    }

Similarly, the **Setup Name Who** state node advances the dialogue stage by 1 if previous
``msg.kitt.stage == 2``:

.. image:: _static/img/alexa/setup-name-who.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

.. code-block:: javascript

    if (msg.kitt.stage === 2) {
        speechText = msg.kitt.speechPunchline;
        cardOutput = msg.kitt.cardPunchline;
        msg.alexa.outputSpeech = {
            ssml: '<speak>' + speechText + '</speak>',
            type: "SSML"
        };
        // the joke completes successfully, end session.
        msg.kitt._session_ended = true;
        return msg;
    }

In addition, it sets ``msg.kitt._session_ended = true;`` because that's end of
the *knock knock* joke!
