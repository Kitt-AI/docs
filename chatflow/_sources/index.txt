Welcome to ChatFlow
====================================

ChatFlow is a platform that provides a simple way to
create conversational agents, or smart bots, using a visual interface.
ChatFlow bots understand natural language, keep track of
context in conversations, connect to a number of APIs
to access external services and resources, and communicate
with users through various text and speech platforms, such
as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Kik, Telegram, SMS, and
Amazon's Alexa platform (Amazon Echo).
