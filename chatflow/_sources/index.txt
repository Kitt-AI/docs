Welcome to ChatFlow
===================

ChatFlow_ is a platform that provides a simple way to
create conversational agents, or smart bots, using a visual interface.
ChatFlow bots understand natural language, keep track of
context in conversations, connect to a number of APIs
to access external services and resources, and communicate
with users through various text and speech platforms, such
as Facebook Messenger, Slack, Kik, Telegram, SMS, and
Amazon's Alexa platform (Amazon Echo).

ChatFlow can be used in conjunction with NLU_, our intuitive and interactive
natural language understanding engine.

Here's a brief video explaining ChatFlow:

This documentation is still under construction. We are still working on the
few more bells and whistles, but otherwise, it is complete!
